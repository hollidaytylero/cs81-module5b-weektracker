Module 5 Assignment 5b
Learning Objectives
Understand how .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() operate and when to use them
Practice passing functions as values and writing your own higher-order functions
Use JavaScript to explore patterns in your own real-world weekly activities
Strengthen your debugging, prediction, and reflection skills through hands-on discovery
Example Output
Analyzing My Weekly Activities...

Total hours spent outdoors: 6.5
Average enjoyment for activities after 8 PM: 7.8
Most common activity type: creative
Low-effort, high-enjoyment activities: Drawing, Cooking

Reflection:
Even though I thought I'd enjoy social events most, solo activities were consistently higher-rated. 
Writing a reusable reduce function helped me isolate patterns I didn’t expect.
  
Tutorial: Key Concepts
What is a Higher-Order Function?
A function that takes another function as input, or returns a function as output.

Common Higher-Order Tools
// map – transform each element
[1, 2, 3].map(n => n * 2); // [2, 4, 6]

// filter – keep matching elements
[1, 2, 3, 4].filter(n => n % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]

// reduce – combine into one value
[1, 2, 3].reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0); // 6
  
Instructions
1. Create Your Weekly Data
In a file called activityTracker.js, define an array called myWeek containing 7 objects—one per day.

Each object must have:

day (string)
activity (string)
category (e.g., physical, creative, social)
hoursSpent (number)
enjoyment (1–10)
timeOfDay (morning, afternoon, evening)
2. Make Predictions
Write comment answers in your JS file:

Which activity will have the highest enjoyment?
What category will dominate your week?
What patterns might exist around time of day?
3. Write Analysis Functions
Write at least 2 functions using .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), or chained combinations. Sample ideas:

Total hours spent outdoors or on physical activity
Average enjoyment by time of day
Most common category
Activities with low hours but high enjoyment
4. Create a Custom Higher-Order Function
Write a function that accepts another function as input. For example:

function filterByCondition(testFn) {
  return myWeek.filter(testFn);
}
filterByCondition(act => act.hoursSpent < 1 && act.enjoyment > 8);
  
REFLECTION.md
In a file named REFLECTION.md, answer the following:

Were your predictions accurate?
What surprised you about your week?
Which higher order function was most useful and why?
